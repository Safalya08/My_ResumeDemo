      <p>
        I'm <strong>Safalya Manditaa Barik</strong> — a passionate and dedicated
        Computer Science student who loves building clean, modern, and 
        user-focused digital experiences. I enjoy working on Web Development,
        Cloud Computing, and impactful projects that help me grow as a developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        My journey began with exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and slowly 
        expanded into backend development, cloud technologies, and real-world 
        projects during my internships. Every project I build teaches me something 
        new — whether it's designing better UI, writing cleaner code, or solving
        problems in a smarter way.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m constantly learning, improving, and expanding my skills through 
        hands-on practice, open-source contributions, and exploring new tools 
        and technologies. I enjoy turning ideas into real, functional solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        This portfolio and resume reflect my growth, my hard work, and my 
        passion for becoming a skilled, confident developer ready to build 
        amazing things.
